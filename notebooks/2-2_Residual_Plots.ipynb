    "In Notebook 2-1, we used OLS regression to model a linear relationship between two variables. A good way to determine if a linear model is appropriate for a given relationship is to examine the __residuals__. We said that residuals are the prediction error, or the vertical distance from a point to the regression line. Let's look at an OLS plot again, and then make a residual plot of the same data to compare."
